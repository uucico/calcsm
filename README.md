# calcsm #

*calcsm* is a barebones implementation of some heuristic scheduling algorithms for single machine production systems. It is the result of some studies in a production programming course taken in 2011.

Implemented strategies:

* *SEQ*: Static Sequence
* *RANDOM*: Random search
* *ENUM*: Exhaustive search
* *ANNL*: Simulated annealing 
* *W(LBE+LBT)*: Weighted Lower Bound Earliness + Lower Bound Tardiness
* *EDD*: Earliest Due Date first
* *TWKR-BY-TIS*: Total Work Content Remaining by Time in System first

Additional information available in the manual. Sorry, portuguese only.
